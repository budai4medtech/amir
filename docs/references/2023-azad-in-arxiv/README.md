## Notes

"9. Medical Report Generation
Medical report generation focuses on producing comprehensive captions and descriptions pivoting on medical images for
diagnostic purposes. Designing automatic methods capable of
performing this task can alleviate tedious and time-consuming
work in producing medical reports and promote medical automation [324]. Recently, advancements in deep learning have
brought the attention of researchers to employing an intelligent
system capable of understanding the visual content of an image and describing its comprehension in natural language format [325]. 
Research efforts in improving this area can be employed in medical imaging by implementing systems capable
of providing descriptions and captions (i.e., generating medical
reports) concerning medical images. 
These captioning systems
usually utilize encoder-decoder models that encode medical im
ages and decode their understandings to provide diagnostic information in a natural language format."
