## Notes

Despite the ability of GANs to quickly generate
high-fidelity samples, their mode coverage is lim-
ited. In addition, VAEs and normalizing flows
have been revealed to have a great deal of diver-
sity; however, they generally have poor sampling
quality. Diffusion models have emerged to com-
pensate for the deficiency of VAEs and GANs
by showing adequate mode coverage and high-
quality sampling. Nevertheless, due to their itera-
tive nature, which causes a slow sampling process,
they are practically expensive and require more
improvement.



"Due to privacy concerns in medical imaging, which limit data integration, diffusion models along with federated learning
can create a profound and robust learning platform in the medical domain. In addition, due to the same privacy concerns,
diffusion models can consolidate their steps in generating synthetic medical data for educational purposes."



"the reverse problem, image-to-text, is still in its early stages [142], which is a promising direction for
research to produce comprehensive texts such as transcripts from medical images as assistive information for physicians.
